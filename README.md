# java-visitor-pattern-only skeleton

Visitor pattern have been implemented. Only the skeleton of the project written. Real busniss logic yet to implemented as required. Let me describe the structure.
### Abstruct customer class:
This class should define a customer.
However I followed the principle "Open for extention close for modification"
To do this, Customer class accept a Visitor class Object.
Customer class extended by two child classes, and child classes override accept(Visitor v) method.

### Interface CustomerVisitor
interface contains child classes visitor methods.
New functionality can be added without modification our Customer class by implementing this visitor interface.
and we can add our new business logic here.
